# Demeter 

This project has been created to help me glue a ton of different technologies
and show that they can work as a coherent whole. The name *demeter* comes from 
greek mythology. She is the sister of Zeus and the goddess of harvest and agriculture.

## Version control architecture

The project uses `meta repo` technology. Please read the instructions [here](https://github.com/mateodelnorte/meta) to understand how this works.
